#SIMPLY MADE PROXY-LESS TIKTOK USERNAME CHECKER

Tool can be wrong, this doesn't use tiktok's API.

# HOW TO USE
Python must be installed
If you don't have python installed, download python 3.7.6 and make sure you click on the 'ADD TO PATH' option during the installation.
Type pip install aiohttp in cmd
Add the usernames you want to check in usernames.txt. Do not put a lot of usernames because you can get rate limited (because this tool is proxyless). It is recommended to check around 500 usernames then wait 24 hours before you can check again.
Make sure you are in the same directory as the folder you downloaded it in. Type python main.py in cmd to run.
Once it is done running, available usernames will be saved in hits.txt.
